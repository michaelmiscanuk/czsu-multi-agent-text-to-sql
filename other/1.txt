    page_content: The current Yearbook primarily describes phenomena that took place in 2023. So what was the year like? At the end of 2023, the population of Czechia was over 10.9 million for the first time since the end of World War II and the positive net migration (94.7 thousand persons) was, after the one in 2022, the second highest in the post-war history of Czechia. In the migration balance, citizens of Ukraine dominated (75.2 thousand), followed by citizens of Slovakia (5.6 thousand), and, for the first time ever, Filipinos (2.1 thousand) ranked third. The year 2023 was further characterised by a considerable twelve percent decrease in the number of marriages. For the first time since 2005, fewer than 100 thousand children (91.1 thousand) were born and the life expectancy at birth was growing for the second year already, thus following a positive trend from before the COVID-19 pandemic.

      page_content: The current Yearbook primarily describes phenomena that took place in 2023. So what was the year like? At the end of 2023, the population of Czechia was over 10.9 million for the first time since the end of World War II and the positive net migration (94.7 thousand persons) was, after the one in 2022, the second highest in the post-war history of Czechia. In the migration balance, citizens of Ukraine dominated (75.2 thousand), followed by citizens of Slovakia (5.6 thousand), and, for the first time ever, Filipinos (2.1 thousand) ranked third. The year 2023 was further characterised by a considerable twelve percent decrease in the number of marriages. For the first time since 2005, fewer than 100 thousand children (91.1 thousand) were born and the life expectancy at birth was growing for the second year already, thus following a positive trend from before the COVID-19 pandemic.

    """Generate PostgreSQL connection string with cloud-optimized parameters.

    This function creates a comprehensive PostgreSQL connection string optimized
    for cloud database services, including advanced timeout and keepalive settings
    for reliable connectivity in distributed environments.

    Returns:
        str: Complete PostgreSQL connection string with optimization parameters

    Connection String Features:
        - SSL mode required for secure cloud connections
        - Unique application name for connection tracking and debugging
        - Comprehensive timeout configuration for cloud latency handling
        - Keepalive settings for connection persistence
        - TCP-level timeout for network reliability

    Application Name Generation:
        - Combines process ID, thread ID, startup time, and random identifier
        - Ensures unique identification for concurrent connections
        - Facilitates debugging and connection monitoring
        - Format: "czsu_langgraph_{pid}_{thread}_{time}_{random}"

    Cloud Optimization Parameters:
        - connect_timeout: Initial connection establishment timeout
        - keepalives_idle: Time before first keepalive probe
        - keepalives_interval: Interval between keepalive probes
        - keepalives_count: Failed keepalives before disconnect
        - tcp_user_timeout: TCP-level connection timeout

    Caching:
        - Connection string is cached globally to avoid regeneration
        - Ensures consistent application names across operations
        - Improves performance for repeated connection operations

    Note:
        - Uses global caching to prevent timestamp conflicts
        - Optimized for cloud PostgreSQL services (Supabase, AWS RDS, etc.)
        - Includes comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

    This function provides standardized connection parameters that are optimized

            - autocommit: Transaction management setting
            - prepare_threshold: Prepared statement management setting

    Connection Parameters:
        autocommit=False:
            - Better compatibility with cloud databases under concurrent load
            - Proper transaction management for data consistency
            - Recommended by LangGraph documentation for cloud deployments

        prepare_threshold=None:
            - Completely disables automatic prepared statement creation
            - Prevents prepared statement conflicts and memory leaks
            - Reduces complexity in connection pool management
            - Eliminates need for prepared statement cleanup in most cases

    Note:
        - Based on LangGraph documentation and cloud database best practices
        - Optimized for concurrent workloads and connection pooling
        - Used by all connection creation functions for consistency
        - Prevents most prepared statement related issues proactively
